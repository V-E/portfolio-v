    description:
      "Passionate about technology and deeply interested in finance, I bring solid Front Office experience in Fixed Income. I specialize in building and maintaining real-time calibration and pricing tools, supporting trading desks in fast-paced environments. I thrive at the intersection of software engineering and market operations, where performance, precision, and impact truly matter. Beyond code, you’ll often find me exploring music, often at the choir, piano or guitar — a different kind of harmony that fuels my creativity and focus.",
